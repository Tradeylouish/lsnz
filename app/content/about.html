    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Laser Sports New Zealand was founded in 2015 and officially became an incorporated society in 2018.
Our main purpose is to help grow the sport of laser tag in New Zealand. We do this by running laser tag leagues and competitions across New Zealand, including the annual ‘New Zealand Invitationals’, which is our largest competition of the year. We also oversee high performance laser tag teams representing New Zealand in overseas competitions, particularly in the Australasian Championships and the World Championships.</p>

    <h2>The committee</h2>
    <p>Laser Sports New Zealand’s committee is made up of 5 volunteers voted in by our players; these consist of our President, 2 Auckland Representatives and 2 Dunedin Representatives. 

Our purpose is to govern Laser Sports New Zealand in all matters including the organising and running of competitions and leagues, making decisions in regards to competition player selections, regrading our players based on performance using LSNZ gradings, and the general running of the society.</p>
